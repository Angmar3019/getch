# getch()
A simple version of getch() for C without the use of conio.h. The code is based on the example of [Kermi3](https://cboard.cprogramming.com/faq-board/27714-faq-there-getch-conio-equivalent-linux-unix.html?highlight=mygetch). It has been modified so that it is possible to use getch on Windows and Linux at the same time. (On MacOs it should also work, but I don't have a device to test it).

## Usage

1. Download `getch.h` and move the file into your project folder
2. Add the header file to your main program with `include "getch.h`
3. After that you can call the function as usual with `getch()`
